# ScrapeMaster : Crawlee Web Scraper

This project is a web scraper built using the [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/) framework, which is a popular open-source web scraping library for Node.js. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Crawlee can be used to extract data from websites and provide insights into their content and structure.

## Features

- Uses the `PlaywrightCrawler` from Crawlee to efficiently navigate and extract data from websites.
- Designed to explore open-source websites and extract valuable information, such as documentation, statistics, and other relevant data.
- Provides a cost-effective alternative to using expensive APIs, especially for projects that require frequent web scraping.
- Leverages the power of the open-source community to enhance the functionality and capabilities of the scraper.

## Getting Started

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Allmight-456/Crawlee_demo.git
## Navigate to the project directory:
    ```cd cd Crawlee_demo
## Install Dependencies and Run :
     ``` npm install 
     
     ``` npm install crawlee playwright
     
     ``` npx install playwright
## Run :
    ```npm run dev
## Exit Chromium browser:
    ```control + c

## Usage

The `index.js` file in this project contains the default code copied from the Crawlee documentation, which uses the `PlaywrightCrawler` to scrape data from a website. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs, such as targeting different websites, extracting different types of data, or adding more advanced features.

## Deployment

While you can run this web scraper locally on your machine, it's often more efficient and scalable to deploy it to a cloud service like [Apify](https://apify.com/). Apify provides a platform for running web crawlers on their cloud infrastructure, which can handle high-volume scraping tasks and provide additional features like proxy management and distributed execution.
